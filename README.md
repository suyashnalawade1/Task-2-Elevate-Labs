Conclusion
Firstly from spam email i pickout random email convert it into text message by giving txt extension. after that i copy whole text and paste to Email Header Analyzer and generate a report.Based on SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks, this email appears technically valid. The sender IP is not blacklisted and is authorized to send on behalf of the domain. However, DMARC policy flags the email for quarantine. This means the email should be treated with caution and the content must be reviewed to ensure no phishing links or messages are present.
